codefundo++ October 2018 Solution Idea

       The idea is to use the data of previous natural disasters to predict the future disasters. The branch of mathematics that deals with the theory of roughness and self similarity is fractal geometry. The disasters in past can be represented as fractals and these fractals are used to predict the next one. So, we would like to use fractal mathematics. We are yet to study about these, but we would like to give it a try.
